This dives into the world of applying application configurations onto the AKS Clusters we build on [Terraform AKS Clusters]. Make sure you have helm and AZ modules installed for these tasks. Kubernetes clusters are extremely complex but very efficient and versatile. Think like you are building an entire ecosystem inside it, you will want layers for things like NGINX, Certificate Management, App Configuration, Monitoring, etc..
